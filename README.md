# Project-Title-Text-to-Speech-Converter-Web-Application-Using-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript
Designed and developed a Text-to-Speech Converter web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Demonstrated proficiency in web development by creating an intuitive and user-friendly tool for converting text into speech, showcasing both creativity and technical skills.

In the "Text-to-Speech Converter Web Application," I designed and built a user-friendly tool that converts written text into spoken words using web technologies. This project combined HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a versatile and accessible platform for text-to-speech conversion.

Summary:

In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency in web development by utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a Text-to-Speech Converter. Here's how each technology contributed to the project:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML provided the structure and layout for the web application. It allowed me to define the user interface, including text input fields and buttons for users to interact with.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS was used to style the web application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. It allowed me to design the layout, choose fonts, colors, and create a responsive design for various screen sizes.

JavaScript: JavaScript was the backbone of the project, as it facilitated the actual text-to-speech conversion. I employed JavaScript to handle user input, process the text, and use a text-to-speech API or library to generate spoken audio from the text. Additionally, JavaScript enabled real-time interactions, making the application intuitive and dynamic.

By designing and developing this Text-to-Speech Converter web application, I not only showcased creativity in addressing a practical need but also demonstrated my technical skills in web development. This project serves as a testament to my ability to create user-friendly and functional web tools that can be appreciated by a broad audience.
